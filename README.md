# StarApps countdown

This is a basic skeleton project, generated by `npm create vite@latest`

## Assignment

Write a Countdown (function) component which accepts a duration & timeBeforeUrgent argument.
- duration: The duration is from where it will start to count downwards to 0
- timeBeforeUrgent: The time before urgent changes the color & font weight of the countdown component when it reaches a certain time left. The text also starts pulsating

Implement the following into `src/App.tsx`

```js
  const duration = '1 day 1 hour 1 minute 10 seconds'
  const timeBeforeUrgent = '1 day 1 hour 30 seconds'

  return (
    <CountDown
      duration={duration}
      timeBeforeUrgent={timeBeforeUrgent}
    />
  )
```
